## Meeting Recap
- Discussed Y.O.U. contract: End date is Dec 31, but they only need to work with us until they get 150 hours
- Mentioned group visit to Hyland
- Ayush: Trying to make the table and submission form look better - ran into issues with adding the submit button, just a styling issue that he's working through
- Halina: edit team profile works! The issue was they had the wrong version of bootstrap installed, but now random words are being put at the bottom of the page so currently trying to figure out why that is happening
  - Turns out there was still an issue with multiple modals being shown - Ross walked through the issue and Halina was working on it
- Tevyah: got a new computer and was taking time to get everything set up, continuing to take time to get everything installed to get things working with python
- Andrew: working on college essays that are due Friday, will look at code on GitHub this weekend

## Plan for Next Week

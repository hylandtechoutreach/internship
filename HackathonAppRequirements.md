# Hackathon App Requirements
The Hackathon App will be a way for mentors and students to connect and communicate throughout a hackathon event. It should be surfaced via the web so that it can be accessed by all hackathon participants, regardless of technology.

## Basic Features
- Admins should be able to load students into the database
  - In the future - students may be able to register directly
- Admins should be able to view project submissions from teams
- Mentors should be able to view a _Team Profile_ for each team, including:
  - Team type (HS / College)
  - Team members (names, schools, grade levels)
  - Struggle levels (do they need help?)
  - Technologies/languages they are using
  - Current project idea
  - Location (if in-person)
  - Contact information
- Mentors should be able to add notes about a team for other members
  - These notes can be used by other mentors in the future
  - They should also appear in the _Team Profile_
- Students should be able to update their _Team Profile_ and individual profiles
- Teams should be able to submit their projects

## Additional Requirements Brainstorm
- List of events, time for events, what's coming next?
  - Timeline/newsfeed
- Authentication system – at least two roles – mentors/attendees
- Does not necessarily need to be hosted online
- Checklist of things for attendees to complete
  - Completion status doesn't necessarily have to be stored – just a place to know all that was needed
- Rubrics for presentation – judging criteria
- Should ideally be built for multiple events
  - A way to record/track past events
- Some way for mentors to send global message – embed discord into the site (?)
- Make it mobile friendly in case anyone has internet troubles

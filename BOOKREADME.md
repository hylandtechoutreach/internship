Hello, and welcome to the Hyland Y.O.U. PEEKE Internship Page.

## Scheduling
For the first two weeks of the internship, there will be a few important meetings:

After these initial weeks, there will likely not be as many meetings to attend. Interns will have to work independently in order to complete their projects.

We are also planning to have individual check-ins, likely on a bi-weekly basis.

## Intern Expectations
There are some basic expectations we hope all interns will be able to meet.

- Be flexible with us - this is the first time we have offered this internship!
- Attend all scheduled Zoom meetings for your group
  - Please let us know if you have a conflict!
- Participate actively during group activities
- Complete any assigned "homework" independently
- Communicate professionally
  - Check your e-mail
  - Check Discord
  - Do not say anything inappropriate
- Reach out and ask for help if you need it
  - Let us know how you're feeling!

## Hours
Interns will be ultimately responsible for keeping track of their own hours.

- Some of your hours will be "direct" - time spent in meetings with us
- Some of your hours will be "homework" that we expect you to complete on your own time
- You may also have "self-driven" hours - if you want to work more, do more research, learn more, etc

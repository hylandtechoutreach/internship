## Intern Experience Description (IED)
A description for the internship experience.

### Overview of Company
Hyland Software is the developer of the enterprise content management and process management software suite called OnBase. Applications of the suite are used in healthcare, financial institutions, insurance, government, higher education and manufacturing. It is an international company based out of Westlake, Ohio.

The Hyland Tech Outreach Team will be responsible for the mentorship of the interns. Tech Outreach provides a variety of programs which teach students computer science to support a future where technology skills are essential, while giving employees the opportunity to give back to the community.

### Description of Internship
Interns will be split into two groups; the Blue Group will include students who have extensive programming experience, and the Green Group will include students who do not. Both groups will see what a career in software development entails, and will have the opportunity to network and learn new skills from Hyland employees.

### Blue Group Description of Activities
The Blue Group will work on a long-term software development project as a team. Guided by Hyland employees, they will be responsible for creating a software product. They will:

- implement features,
- make design decisions,
- manage their time/workload,
- split up tasks,
- and more

Through this process, they will see how software projects are managed at the enterprise level. They will also learn to work with new technologies, and grow their skills as software developers.

### Green Group Description of Activities
The Green Group will work on learning the basics of Website Development. They will follow instructor-led and self-paced material from Hyland's Hy-Tech Club **Web 101** and **Web 102** courses. They will learn about the following topics:

#### Web 101
- HTML Elements (headers, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and more)
- CSS Styles (color, background, font-size, and more)
- CSS Selectors (element selector, class selector, id selector)

#### Web 102
- JavaScript alerts and prompts
- JavaScript conditionals
- JavaScript functions and buttons
- JavaScript DOM Manipulation

They will then apply their skills to create a project. Their projects should demonstrate what's possible to build with Web 101 and Web 102 concepts. The Hyland Tech Outreach team may use the projects they create for marketing, future course offerings, and more.

Beyond the basic Web 102 project, green group interns will be able to expand their programming skills on their own, with support from mentors. They should work toward another final project of their choosing.

## Meeting Recap
Ended up giving students time to work on their projects, which they presented at the end. Decided to proceed with C# 101.

## Plan for Next Week
Start with project presentations if they have them. Then, begin C# 101 curriculum with the HelloCS lesson and the Variables & Data Types lesson.

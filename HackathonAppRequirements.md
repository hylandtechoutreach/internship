# Hackathon App Requirements
The Hackathon App will be a way for mentors and students to connect and communicate throughout a hackathon event. It should be surfaced via the web so that it can be accessed by all hackathon participants, regardless of technology.

## Basic Features
- Admins should be able to load students into the database
- Admins should be able to view project submissions from teams
- Mentors should be able to view a _Team Profile_ for each team, including:
  - Team type (HS / College)
  - Team members (names, schools, grade levels)
  - Struggle levels (do they need help?)
  - Technologies/languages they are using
  - Current project idea
  - Location (if in-person)
  - Contact information
- Mentors should be able to add notes about a team for other members
  - These notes can be used by other mentors in the future
  - They should also appear in the _Team Profile_
- Students should be able to update their _Team Profile_ and individual profiles
- Teams should be able to submit their projects

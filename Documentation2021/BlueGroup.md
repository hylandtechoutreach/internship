# PEEKE Interns - Blue Group
The blue group intern project is an app for the Hyland Hackathon. These are general notes for the entire project. For documentation about individual sessions, check the [Blue Session Notes](BlueSessionNotes/) folder.

## Notes
Started by having interns decide on technology stack and architecture - they did research and the team decided to use a REST API with:

- Django
- MySQL (later changed to SQLite)
- ReactJS

The original idea was to not use a REST API, but it was decided to use a REST API to de-couple the front-end and back-end.

After making some decisions, students did some research and learned about some of the technologies.

Students began to design the UX of the app. Work and designs were tracked on [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/fCQmyiKQ/3d4582fd28a1776f4897ed36e0db8b15/hackathon-app-project-2021-blue-group).

## GitHub
Students used GitHub to store source code. Each team member had forks for the [front-end](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/hackathon-app-front-end) and [back-end](https://github.com/hylandtechoutreach/hackathon-app-back-end) repositories. After cloning their forks locally, they would:

- Fetch upstream via the web
- Pull changes down to local clone from their remote
- Make changes, push them up to their fork
- Make pull requests between their fork and the main repo

## Tutorials
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5ygXQKF6M8 (not great but Tevyah followed this one)

## Software
- Python
- Django
- VS Code
- Postman
- NodeJS (for NPM)
- Git

## Areas for Improvement
- Make more decisions ahead of time
  - tech stack, architecture, database structure, API endpoints
- More guidance
- Do not start from nothing
- Better separation of work
  - make it easier for everyone to work simultaneously

# Hyland Tech Outreach High School Internship
Plan for an educational high school internship through Hyland's Tech Outreach Team. Partnered with Y.O.U. for their 2021 PEEKE Internship.

## Basic Information - PEEKE Internship
https://www.youthopportunities.org/stories/2019/1/peeke-yous-new-internship-program

- The summer internship will be **150 hours** total.
- This should give interns an opportunity to **explore a career path** of their interest.
- Interns will receive a **stipend**.
- Interns who complete the program may be eligible for an **OhioMeansJobs-Readiness Seal**.
- Interns may have experience with computer science, or they may not.

## Goals
What do we hope interns gain from this experience?

- Interns should understand what it is like to work at a software company.
 - They should participate in Hyland intern activities as able.
- Interns should learn new skills that are of value in the software world.
- Interns should practice communicating professionally.
- Interns should practice collaboration skills.
- Interns should have an opportunity to produce something of value.
- Interns should be challenged sufficiently.
- Interns should have the opportunity to be creative.

## General Skill Building
Regardless of the specific project experience, each intern should have an opportunity for some general professional development. Some examples could include:

- Learning [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- Taking notes during a meeting or lesson
- Writing e-mails
- Tracking work, especially as a team
- Resume reviews, mock interviews
- Marketing
- Contributing to open source projects

## Schedule
The schedule for the 150 hours of the internship will be flexible, but there are some basic items that should happen at certain times.

### Orientation
Before jumping into the projects, there should be some time to onboard the interns.

- Team Introductions
- Setting Expectations
- [Intake Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc55bKh9aMjfW-RtpxshSIFU25Agx_8EyLmgzqBb7p9LYdhsg/viewform)
- Icebreakers / Games

### Throughout the Internship
- Daily stand-up meetings at 1pm with all interns
 - This is a way for us to know what they are working on
- Work/meeting time from 1pm-3pm 
- Bi-weekly check-ins with each individual student
 - This is an opportunity for a more individual check-in
- Y.O.U. will accept the amount of work for hours even if they get it done early

### Educational Track Schedule
For the educational track, the interns should mainly focus on learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of this should be instructor-led, but the students should also be able to work independently. Interns should use Replit to store their work.

During independent work, interns can ask questions as needed. 

- The first week can be general onboarding stuff
- Getting through a course of material = 20 hours
- Web 101 - first two lessons should be instructor-led (2 hrs/ lesson)
  - The next lessons can be self-paced (2 hrs/ lesson)
    - There are video recordings for each session
  - Intro to CSS lesson can be instructor-led as well
  - Try to get done in one week
  - No final project
- Web 102 - first two lessons should be instructor-led (2 hrs/ lesson)
  - The next lessons can be self-paced (2 hrs/ lesson)

Should be done with instructor-led material by the end of July - the remainder of the time should mainly be self-paced. This should make scheduling easier and more flexible, especially if an intern has to go back to school or has other responsibilities.

### Experienced Track Schedule
Most of the time for the experienced interns will be spent independently, or working as a team. However, there are some important preliminary meetings. These should help the interns plan their project work.

- Project Overview Meeting: An overall look at what we hope to accomplish by the end of the project
  - This is from a top-level user perspective - stakeholders should be present
- Architecture Review Meeting: A discussion of potential architectures/technologies that could be used for the project
  - This is from a technical perspective - only the architect needs to be present
- Initial Planning Meeting: Creating cards, narrowing down tasks, and figuring out who can do what
- Demos/Planning: Throughout the internship, there should be check-ins with the team

## Projects
Interns may have some options for projects. Each project should have:

- Stakeholders (likely the Tech Outreach team)
- Value to the stakeholders
- Challenges and opportunities for learning
- A balance of guidance and self-determination
- A collaborative aspect

### Hyland Hackathon Web Application
Interns could create a web application for both mentors and students to use during the Hyland Hackathon. This project would provide real value to the Tech Outreach Team.

This project would be an option for interns who already have a good amount of coding experience.

- Some requirements should be provided.
- The design and implementation should be up to the intern team.
- Interns should figure out which technologies to use.
 - This will likely require them to learn something new.
- They should consider the user experience and data required for the application.
- Interns should have design guidance from the stakeholders, as well as technical guidance.
- Interns should collaborate, possibly using GitHub.

### Curriculum Design
Interns could help design a lesson/program/workshop we could use as the Tech Outreach team.

This project would be an option for interns who already have a good amount of coding experience.

- This could possibly involve video production.
- Interns should bring their own perspectives to figure out what would be the most engaging for students.
- Interns can work with stakeholders to determine the best topic to teach.
- Interns will be able to contribute to a Hyland GitHub repository.

### Testing Tech Outreach Curriculum
Interns could provide us valuable feedback about our current programs. As students, they could walk through the material self-paced and see how well they are able to learn. This could culminate in a final project that could help us as well.

This project would be an option for interns who do not have coding experience.

- Interns could complete our Web 101 and Web 102 courses, with help from instructors.
 - They should show their work, to be evaluated by stakeholders.
- Their final project could be to build a marketing website for the Tech Outreach Team.

#### Testing Other Tools
Interns could also try going through other tutorials, like:
- [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/)
- [Ozaria](https://www.ozaria.com/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
- Anything else

Whichever materials they use, their feedback could be valuable for us. This could be from a quality assurance perspective, or from a research perspective.

### Other Ideas
- Have interns work on administrative tasks of some kind
- Have interns help facilitate our programs
- Have interns help with marketing / recruitment efforts

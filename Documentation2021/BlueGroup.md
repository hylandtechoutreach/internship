# PEEKE Interns - Blue Group
The blue group intern project is an app for the Hyland Hackathon.

## Notes
Started by having interns decide on technology stack and architecture - they did research and the team decided to use a REST API with:

- Django
- MySQL (later changed to SQLite)
- ReactJS

The original idea was to not use a REST API, but it was decided to use a REST API to de-couple the front-end and back-end.

After making some decisions, students did some research and learned about some of the technologies.

Students began to design the UX of the app

## Software
- Python
- Django
- VS Code
- Postman
- NodeJS (for NPM)

## Areas for Improvement
- Make more decisions ahead of time
  - tech stack, architecture, database structure, API endpoints
- More guidance
- Do not start from nothing
- Better separation of work
  - make it easier for everyone to work simultaneously
